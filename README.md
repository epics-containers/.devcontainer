# .devcontainer
vscode devcontainer configuration for working with EPICS Containers


## Quick Start for a Workspace
Most likely you want to fork this repo to create your personal developer container.

These steps clone directly from this repo, but you get the idea!

- cd root_folder_for_your_new_workspace
- git clone https://github.com/epics-containers/.devcontainer
- code .devcontainer
- open a terminal in vscode
- cd ..
- clone https://github.com/your_org/your_first_repo_for_this_workspace
- ctrl-shift-P add folder to Workspace ...
- choose the above repo folder
- File->Save Workspace As ...
- choose a filename for your workspace. IMPORTANT - save this in root_folder_for_your_new_workspace
  - the default folder will be .devcontainer and you don't want that.
- ctrl-shift-P Reopen in Container

That's it you now have a devcontainer workspace.
